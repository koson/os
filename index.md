## Intro
I'm making a DSO! I've named it the OS-1. Here are the planned specs; some
might be "stretch goals":

* 100 MHz analog bandwidth
* 400 MHz [alias-free](aliasfree.html) sampling rate
* Frontend from 500 ÂµV/div to 10 V/div with switchable termination and probe detect
* Two channels, extensible to four
* Full math capabilities
* Serial decode
* Programmable digital trigger
* Segmented memory

## Backplane
The OS-1 will be based on a backplane for modularity and upgrade capability.

## Frontend
The analog frontend is still in the very early stage of design.
